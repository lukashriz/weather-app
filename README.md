🎨 Design Philosophy
I wanted a weather app that feels calm, clear, and client-friendly — no clutter, no sharp edges, just smooth interactions and soft shadows.
Every element is rounded, spaced generously, and animated with subtle hover effects to create a premium feel without overwhelming the user.
